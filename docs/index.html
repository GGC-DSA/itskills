    <h1>About The Project</h1>
    <p>We are developing a tool to help Georgia Gwinnett College students figure out which classes to take in order to build "/n"
        the correct skills for entry level jobs in IT. Allowing students to be better prepared for applying to those jobs,
        Grizzly Paths is in the early stages of development, and we will present its first version of the site along with data
        collected that displays how we related the jobs, skills, and courses.</p>
