      <h1>About The Project</h1>
      <p>
        Our team is currently working on the development of an innovative tool 
        called Grizzly Paths, which aims to assist students at Georgia Gwinnett College 
        in determining the most suitable classes to take in order to acquire the necessary skills 
        for entry-level jobs in the field of Information Technology (IT). 
        By providing students with a comprehensive overview of the job market 
        and the skills required by employers, Grizzly Paths will enable them 
        to make informed decisions when selecting their coursework. 
        As we are still in the early stages of development, 
        we are excited to showcase the first version of the website, 
        along with the data we have collected, 
        which demonstrates how we have correlated the jobs, skills, and courses. 
        Through this endeavor, our goal is to empower Georgia Gwinnett College students 
        with the knowledge and preparation they need to excel in their IT careers 
        and secure meaningful employment opportunities.
