As GGC (Georgia Gwinnett College) information technology students' progress in their degree, they may not be obtaining the adequate skills required for the job they want to pursue. Our project, Grizzly Insights, allows these upcoming graduates to discover what their job goals require in skills and what classes these students can take to meet those requirements. These jobs/requirements are visualized using python, tableau, etc.
