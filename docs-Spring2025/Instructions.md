# How to run the website
## Through an IDE
<li> Clone the repo to your local computer</li>
<li> Open up your desired IDE (VS Code preferred) and open the cloned repo in it</li>
<li> Create 2 terminal tabs</li>
<li> Ensure you're in the main branch</li>
<li> On the first tab, navigate to my-vue-app/backend directory</li>
<li> Run this command: python app.py</li>
<li> Ensure it runs properly with no errors</li>
<li> On the second terminal tab, navigate to my-vue-app </li>
<li> Check if npm is installed by running: npm -v</li>
<li> If it isn't installed, download it from <a href="https://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a></li>
<li> If it is installed run this command: npm install</li>
<li>After that, run: npm run dev</li>
<li> A local host link will be made and you can view the website</li>
<li>If you want to view the code that gives the website link go to this branch: final-deploy</li>

## Through CLI
<li>Steps are similar to above except opening 2 terminals on the IDE, just open 2 terminal instances on your Desktop</li>
<li>Follow the steps for backend setup in the first terminal and frontend setup in the second terminal as outlined above</li>
