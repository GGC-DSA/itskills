Robotics Engineer - Motion Planning & Controls,Red Rabbit Robotics,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","About us: At Red Rabbit Robotics, our mission is to tackle the global labor shortage and create a future of abundance. We aim to deploy one million humanoid robots in the next 10 years. Our robots are designed to tackle manual labor across manufacturing, warehouse, logistics and more. Our “teleoperation first” strategy immediately delivers value by providing humanoid labor as a service through remote operators, while simultaneously building a powerful data flywheel that fuels the foundation models for robotics and leads to full autonomy for physical world AI. Founded just a few months ago, we have already built two generations of humanoid robot prototypes, secured venture backing, and attracted major customers eager to try out our solution. With real time human oversight and a powerful data flywheel, we are building embodied AI systems that can work in the real world in the same way as we do. What we believe: We are all about our customers. We talk to real folks in the industry to find out what they actually need, then we build products that solve those problems. Simple as that. We are agnostic to different technical approaches. There is no single “silver bullet” for real world robotics. We stay open-minded, keep learning, and try whatever works best. We keep it practical. For example, our robots have wheels, not legs (no backflips in the near future). We don’t waste time over-engineering fancy features that don’t make a real difference for our customers’ success. The role: We’re looking for a Robot Engineer to own the design and implementation of our humanoid robot’s control systems. A major responsibility in this role is helping us evaluate and select the right technology stack. You’ll be deeply involved in real-time control loops, sensor fusion, actuator integration, and higher-level motion planning algorithms. This role is in person for our Vancouver, Canada office that starts in February, 2025. What you will do: Design, implement, and optimize real-time control architectures (manipulation, navigation, teleoperation). Investigate and compare frameworks and algorithms to guide our core software platform decisions. Integrate sensors (LiDAR, vision, IMU, force/torque) and actuators (BLDC servo motors). Develop algorithms for motion planning, kinematics, and advanced control strategies. Collaborate closely with hardware and operations teams to ensure cohesive system integration. Create testing procedures for both simulation and real hardware to validate performance and reliability. What you will bring: Proficiency in C++ or Rust (experience with ROS/ROS2 is a big plus). Strong foundation in control theory, kinematics, and dynamics of robotic systems. Proven track record of shipping code code for commercial or open-source robotics projects that have high impacts. Experience with real-time embedded systems and safety-critical software. Excellent problem-solving skills and a willingness to adapt and learn. Hands on experience building and debugging electrical and mechanical systems. Knowledge of machine learning for robotics and advanced motion planning. Background using simulation tools like Gazebo, Mujuco or Nvidia Isaac Sim. Being able to speak Chinese and communicating with our vendors directly is a bonus.

Afstudeeropdracht Software Development: Event Insight - De mobiele agenda voor kennisdeling en samenwerking,Info Support,"Veenendaal, Utrecht, Netherlands","Ontwikkel een mobiele app die collega’s helpt bij het organiseren, plannen en volgen van interne kennisevents zoals workshops, hackathons en wekelijkse kennisbijeenkomsten. Door alle evenementen centraal inzichtelijk te maken voor alle collega’s, zorg je ervoor dat deelnemers altijd op de hoogte zijn van aankomende sessies en dat organisatoren eenvoudig dubbele boekingen kunnen voorkomen. Benodigde interesse(s) Software Development DevOps Wat krijg je Een uitdagende afstudeeropdracht Afstudeervergoeding: € 1000 bruto of € 500 bruto + leaseauto of € 600 bruto + woonruimte Professionele begeleiding Trainingen gericht op jouw afstudeertraject Sparren met andere afstudeerders en collega’s Twee vakantiedagen per maand Wat je gaat doen 35% Afstudeeronderzoek 40% Analyseren, ontwerpen, realiseren 25% Documentatie Binnen Info Support worden regelmatig diverse evenementen georganiseerd, zoals workshops, hackathons, wekelijkse kennisbijeenkomsten en de ISKA (Info Support Kennis Avonden), waarin collega’s de laatste ontwikkelingen in IT delen en samenwerken aan interessante projecten. Deze events bieden een waardevolle kans voor kennisdeling en samenwerking, maar het ontbreekt vaak aan overzicht van het volledige aanbod. Hierdoor missen collega’s soms waardevolle sessies, of plannen organisatoren per ongeluk overlappende evenementen. Momenteel ontbreekt een gecentraliseerd systeem dat zowel deelnemers als organisatoren een overzicht geeft van geplande events. Deelnemers hebben moeite om op de hoogte te blijven van aankomende evenementen, terwijl organisatoren vaak geen inzicht hebben in mogelijke conflicten bij het plannen van nieuwe activiteiten. Het idee is om een mobiele app te ontwikkelen die dit probleem oplost door een centrale, toegankelijke agenda te bieden voor alle events. De opdracht Ontwikkel een mobiele app die zowel organisatoren als deelnemers ondersteunt bij het plannen en volgen van events binnen Info Support. Begin met een onderzoek naar de meest geschikte manier om eventdata op te slaan en te beheren: is een integratie met Microsoft Teams voldoende, of biedt een eigen database meer flexibiliteit en controle? Op basis van dit onderzoek bouw je een Proof of Concept (PoC) van de app, waarbij de gekozen datastructuur wordt geïntegreerd.

Afstudeeropdracht in Data Engineering: TOMP-API Compliancy Validator (Project SPITS),Info Support,"Veenendaal, Utrecht, Netherlands","De TOMP-werkgroep streeft naar een internationale standaard voor communicatie tussen vervoerders en MaaS-aanbieders. Tijdens deze afstudeeropdracht onderzoek je het gebruik van AI in het testen van API’s volgens OpenAPI-specificaties. Het gaat hier bijvoorbeeld om het onttrekken van informatie uit specificaties met Natural Language Processing, het genereren van testdata en tests en de validatie van API’s ten opzichte van hun specificatie. Nieuwsgierig? Lees dan vooral verder. Benodigde interesse(s) Natural Language Processing (NLP) Large Language Models (LLM) Language Understanding Code Generation OpenAPI Specification Testing Wat krijg je Een uitdagende afstudeeropdracht Afstudeervergoeding: € 1000 bruto of € 500 bruto + leaseauto of € 600 bruto + woonruimte Professionele begeleiding Trainingen gericht op jouw afstudeertraject Sparren met andere afstudeerders en collega’s Twee vakantiedagen per maand Wat je gaat doen 35% Afstudeeronderzoek 40% Analyseren, ontwerpen, realiseren 25% Documentatie Deze afstudeeropdracht maakt onderdeel uit van het afstudeerproject Sustainable Public Integrated Transport Solution ( SPITS ). Met dit project zetten we ons in om voor reizigers de ideale reiservaring-oplossing te bieden, het OV veel toegankelijker te maken en een stuk duurzamer. De TOMP-werkgroep heeft tot doel om een internationaal beheerde, interoperabele open standaard voor technische communicatie tussen vervoerders en MaaS-aanbieders te ontwikkelen en in stand te houden door middel van definitie, verbetering, afstemming en verspreiding. Een uitdaging bij deze API-standaard is dat openbaar vervoerders (PTO’s) het vervoer op heel verschillende manieren faciliteren. Denk bijvoorbeeld aan: werken met dienstregelingen reizen op aanvraag, zoals taxi’s of bussen deelbare scooters Er kunnen dus heel verschillende implementaties van de API’s zijn die zich anders gedragen dan je zou verwachten op basis van de OpenAPI-documentatie die door TOMP naar voren is gebracht. Maar hoe valideer je een TOMP API-implementatie met AI met als resultaat, of score, hoe goed de implementatie zich gedraagt ten opzichte van de specificatie. De opdracht Tijdens deze afstudeeropdracht ga je onderzoeken of en hoe we AI kunnen gebruiken om een API te testen op basis van een OpenAPI-specificatie. Dit hoeft dus niet noodzakelijk een TOMP API te zijn. Gebruik Natural Language Processing (NLP) om relevante informatie uit API-specificaties te extraheren. Genereer testdata voor de API’s (bijvoorbeeld op basis van andere open standaarden). Genereer automatische tests voor de API’s door de geëxtraheerde API-informatie te combineren met de gegenereerde testdata. Valideer de conformiteit van de geteste API met de bestaande API-specificatie. Wil je meer lezen over het gehele afstudeerproject SPITS? Klik dan hier .
